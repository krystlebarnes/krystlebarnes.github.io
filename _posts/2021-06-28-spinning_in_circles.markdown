For my final project I of course stuck with the recipe app, since it was my original dream to build a pretty complex meal planning app. I ended up making the recipe app too complex for the amount of time I have, so there's not much to it at the moment, but I'm excited to continue building it up. 

React and redux definitely have my head spinning around in circles. Why is that? Because things are constantly getting updated and spit back out. Particularly with how controlled components work in forms. When creating a form, you can create a function that allows you to update the state as you type, and that updated value shows in the form field as you type. It's magic! 

I'll admit my head was spinning in circles for another reason as well. There is a lot of connecting going on and sometimes trying to follow this path of connection can feel like I'm just going around in circles trying to debug an issue.

For anyone looking to better understand React, I highly recommend searching on YouTube, as there are a lot of developers giving helpful tutorials on there!
