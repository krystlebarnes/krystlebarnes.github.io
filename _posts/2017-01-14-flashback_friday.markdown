Today marks day three in my coding journey with the Flatiron School, but it has been a long time coming. My first experience coding was almost two decades ago, in the late 90's. I was a teenybopper then. I spent my days singing along to the Backstreet Boys album with my friends and flipping through the latest BOP and Tiger Beat magazines.

Then July 18, 1998 happened. That's when 'N Sync in Concert aired on the Disney Channel, and just like the many other teenyboppers tuning in, I was converted. I instantly became a die-hard 'N Sync fan, never to pickup my Backstreet Boys album again. I now spent my time figuring out ways I could prove that I was their number one fan. Until one day, I figured it out.

I needed to create my own fan page, and it had to be the best. If I had the ultimate fan page, then I would be the ultimate fan. So that is exactly what I did. Well, was it the *best*? Probably not, but I thought it was pretty sweet. Using HTML and CSS, I made something that I was proud of. It was exciting to figure out how to get a web page to look exactly how I wanted and do exactly what I wanted. 

Then I came to a realization. I was turning into a *computer geek*. Out of fear of being labeled a computer geek, I decided to focus on some cooler hobbies and my coding journey was put on hold for a little bit. 

Fast-forward to today. I work in online education at a university in San Francisco, a city submerged in tech. My current position allows me to solve problems and increase efficiency with the help of coding, which I *love*. However, I also know there are more problems I can solve if I had more programming skills, which is why I'm continuing full-force on the journey I started many years ago. No turning back.
